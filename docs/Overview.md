# Overview: Microsoft 365 Defender Portal

The Microsoft 365 Defender Portal is the centralized security hub for organizations using Microsoft 365. It detects, investigates, and responds to security incidents affecting identities, endpoints, email, and collaboration tools. Key features include:

- **Incident & Alert Management:**  
  Collects and correlates alerts from Microsoft 365 services (e.g., Exchange Online, Defender for Endpoint), grouping them into incidents with defined severity, category, and impacted assets.

- **Action Center:**  
  Serves as a dashboard to track incident activities, letting security analysts filter, manage, and resolve incidents systematically.

- **Secure Score:**  
  Evaluates the security posture across identities, apps (e.g., Exchange, Teams), and devices; provides actionable recommendations.

- **Threat Analytics Dashboard:**  
  Offers global threat intelligence, including common attack techniques and insights into how active threats impact Microsoft 365 environments.

- **Attack Simulation Training:**  
  Enables simulated incident generation for training purposes to help teams prepare for real-world threats.

- **Advanced Threat Hunting with KQL:**  
  Leverages Kusto Query Language (KQL) for searching logs and proactively investigating potential attacks.

This repository breaks down these components and provides sample queries, dashboards, automation scripts, and documentation to help you understand and leverage the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal.
