# Incident & Alert Management

## Key Aspects:
- **Alert Collection:**  
  The portal collects alerts from various Microsoft 365 services.
  
- **Incident Grouping:**  
  Alerts are grouped by incidentâ€”detailing severity, category (e.g., phishing, malware), and impacted assets (users, devices, mailboxes).

## How It Works:
- Alerts are continuously received and correlated.
- Incidents provide a consolidated view to enable rapid investigation and response.

For more details, refer to the official Microsoft documentation.
